### Digital Software Agency
For more than 10 years, we have been helping the best companies with software challenges, platform integrations and ecommerce solutions.
With our roots in secondment, we have made a transition in recent years to working on projects as a digital software agency. 
When working with us, you always get an honest story. Because that is a key success factor, which is strangely enough often lacking.

### We specialise in customised applications
We specialise in specific tech stacks, with which we build your custom software in modern technology.

### We build innovative ecommerce solutions
These solutions are very diverse, innovative and always based on the BigCommerce platform.

### We develop customised integrations
We love complexity and have a track record with integrations in PSD2, payments, ticketing, ecommerce and loyalty.
